## Assignment 1 - Basic Character Animation

In this assignment, you will learn the basic data structure and animation creation pipeline and are required to create an animation clip with provided Infrastructure. Also, you need to understand the mathematics in FK and IK for reading the motion capture files and playing with them.

All software-related codes will be provided by @[Mingyi Shi](https://rubbly.cn) and @[He Zhang](https://cghezhang.github.io), only the core codes need to be filled in.

More details: [subfolder](./assignment_1)

#### Assessments (due to 13th. Feb)

* A rendered video with character animation (Quiz1, 15%)
* BVH file visualizer in Blender/Unity (45%)
* An IK solver in Unity (30%)
* Report (10%)



## Assignment 2 - Data Driven Character Animation

In this assignment, you will learn the basic knowledge of sequential prediction with a deep neural network and learn the specifications which are useful in character animation.
The TAs will provide a runnable character animation framework that includes all the data processing, training/testing, and visualization functions, but the network works not well on human motion data. You are required to modify the data flow or network structure to make it available. (due to 13th. March )



## Assignment 3 - TBA

## Assignment 4 - TBA
