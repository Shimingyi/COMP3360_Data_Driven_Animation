## Assignment 1 - Basic Character Animation

In this assignment, you will become familiar with fundamental data structures and the animation creation workflow. Your task is to craft an animation clip using the provided infrastructure.
Also, you need to understand the mathematical concepts behind Forward Kinematics (FK) and Inverse Kinematics (IK), and then to interpret the motion capture files and interact with them.

Details: [[subfolder](./assignment_1)]

#### Tutorial Slides

1. Basic Linear Algebra in Graphics [[slide](./COMP3360_ANI_T1.pdf)]
2. Forward and Inverse Kinematics [[slide](./COMP3360_ANI_T2.pdf)]

#### Assessments
