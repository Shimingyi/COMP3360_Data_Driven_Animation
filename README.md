## Assignment 1 - Basic Character Animation

In this assignment, you will learn the basic data structure and animation creation pipeline and are required to create an animation clip with provided Infrastructure. Also, you need to understand the mathematics in FK and IK to read the motion capture files and play with them.

All software-related codes will be provided by @[Mingyi Shi](https://rubbly.cn) and @[He Zhang](https://cghezhang.github.io). Only the core codes need to be filled in.

All the materials have been uploaded: [subfolder](./assignment_1)

#### Tutorial Slides

1. Data Structure in Character Animation [[slides](./tutorial1_data_structure.pdf)]
2. Scripting with BVH file and IK solver [[slides](./tutorial2_scripting.pdf)]

#### Assessments (due to 11:59 am, 18th. Feb)

* A rendered video with character animation (Quiz1, 15%)
* BVH file visualizer in Blender/Unity (45%)
* An IK solver in Unity (30%)
* Report (10%)



## Assignment 2 - Data-Driven Character Animation

This assignment will teach you how to observe motion data and process it with different tools like the mathematics interpolation algorithm and AutoEncoder model. Given a motion clip shaped with (T, J, R), understanding the difference between temporal and spatial dimensions will be the key to processing it. You will practice it by following tasks.
